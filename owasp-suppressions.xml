        This suppresses CVE-2019-12415 for Apache POI v4.0.1. These artifacts are pulled in by Tika.
        Attempted to upgrade to unaffected version (4.1.1.) of Apache POI, but it caused unit
         tests to fail. This suppression can be removed when Tika upgrades its Apache POI
         dependencies to an unaffected version.
